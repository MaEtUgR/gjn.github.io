# The search engine ware in the later 90's

Superior algo? -> weight by incoming links
Superior advertising? -> good advertising strategy, though monetisation was easy.

No, it was all in the UI. UX design is very important.

# The evidence

Show pictures by end of 90s from Lycos, Yahoo, Alta Vista and Google

-> remove options for user and offer them only what you are really
good at
-> win

# What this means for web mapping

-> Remove bloat
